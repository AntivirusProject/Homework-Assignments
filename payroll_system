Payroll System Using Inheritance and Polymorphism

1. Implement an interface called EmployeeInfo with the following constant variables:

FACULTY_MONTHLY_SALARY = 5000.00
STAFF_MONTHLY_HOURS_WORKED = 160
2. Implement an abstract class Employee with the following requirements:

Attributes
last name (String)
first name (String)
ID number (String)
Sex - M or F
Birth date (Date) - Use the Java Calendar Java class. 
Default argument constructor and argument constructors.
Public methods
toString - returning a string with the following format:
ID Employee number :_________
Employee name: __________ 
Birth date: _______
get and set methods
abstract method monthlyEarning that returns the monthly earning.
3. Implement a class called Staff extending from the class Employee with the following requirements:

Attribute
Hourly rate
Default argument and argument contructors
Public methods
get and set
The method monthlyEarning returns monthly salary (hourly rate times 160)
toString - returning a string with the following format:
ID Employee number :_________
Employee name: __________ 
Birth date: _______ 
Full Time 
Monthly Salary: _________
Implelment a class Education with the following requirements:

Attributes
Degree (MS or PhD )
Major (Engineering, Chemistry, English, etc ... )
Research (number of researches)
Default argument and argument constructors.
Public methods
get and set
Implement a class Faculty extending from the class Employee with the following requirements:

Attributes
Level
"AS": assistant professor
"AO": associate professor
"FU": professor
Education object
Default argument and argument constructor
Public methods
get and set
The method monthlyEarning returns monthly salary based on the faculty's level.
AS - faculty monthly salary
AO - 1.2 times faculty monthly salary
FU - 1.4 times faculty monthly salary
toString - returning a string with the following format:
ID Employee number :_________
Employee name: __________ 
Birth date: _______ 
XXXXX Professor where  XXXXX can be Assistant, Associate or Full 
Monthly Salary: _________
Implement a class called Partime extending from the class Staff with the following requirements:

Attributes
Hours worked per week
Default argument and argument constructors
Public methods
set and get
The method monthlyEarning returns monthly salary which hourly rate multiplied hours worked per week multiplied four.
toString - returning a string with the following format:
ID Employee number :_________
Employee name: __________ 
Birth date: _______ 
Hours works per month: ______ 
Monthly Salary: _________
Implement a test driver program that creates a one-dimensional array of class Employee to store the objects Staff, Faculty and Partime. 

Using polymorphism, display the following outputs: 

a. Employee information using the method toString

Staff
Faculty
Part-time
b. Total monthly salary for all the part-time staff .
c. Total monthly salary for all employees.
d. Display all employee information ascending by employee id using interface Comparable
e. Display all employee information descending by last name using interface Comparer
f. Duplicate a faculty object using clone. Verify the duplication.
